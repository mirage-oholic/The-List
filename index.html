          data-tags="Jack O’Donnell, who oversaw the Atlantic City Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino froom 1987 to 1990 spoke to CNN about Trump's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein:
'In my mind, [Epstein] was his best friend, you know, [throughout] the time I was there for four years,'' O'Donnell said in the interview, noting that the pair 'frequently' came to Trump's casino together.
One alleged instance stood out to the former casino boss. He claimed that one night in the late 1980s, Trump and Epstein visited Trump Plaza with three women and brought them onto the casino floor despite them being under 21.
O'Donnell said he found out about the incident the following day, when state casino commission inspectors were waiting for him in his office. An inspector, it seems, had identified one of the girls with Trump and Epstein as 'the No. 3-ranked tennis player in the world.'
'This [inspector] happened to be a tennis fan and he said, 'Jack, I know she's 19 years old,' ' O'Donnell said. 'They had determined that the women that they brought down were underage to be in the casino.'
In the state of New Jersey, it is illegal for anyone under 21 to gamble on a casino floor. Despite the law, O'Donnell claims the commission gave Trump a 'break' for the incident, but told him to warn the future president about the potential consequences.
“I had to call them and say, 'They're giving you a break this time, but if this happens again, the fine is going to be substantial and it's going to be on your head,' ' he claimed.
O'Donnell also claimed to have told Trump that continuing to hang out with Epstein and underage women was 'not gonna look good.''I did tell him in that conversation, 'I don’t think you should be hanging out with this guy, just so you know, and you certainly shouldn’t be doing that in Atlantic City,' ' he said.

                "They had determined that the women that they brought down were
                underage to be in the casino.” </i
              ><br /><br />
              In the state of New Jersey, it is illegal for anyone under 21 to
              gamble on a casino floor. Despite the law, O'Donnell claims the
              commission gave Trump a <i>"break"</i> for the incident, but told
              him to warn the future president about the potential consequences.
              <br /><br /><i>
                “I had to call them and say, 'They're giving you a break this
                time, but if this happens again, the fine is going to be
                substantial and it's going to be on your head,' "
              </i>
              he claimed.<br /><br />
              O'Donnell also claimed to have told Trump that continuing to hang
              out with Epstein and underage women was “not gonna look good.”<br /><br />
              <i>
                "I did tell him in that conversation, 'I don’t think you should
                be hanging out with this guy, just so you know, and you
                certainly shouldn’t be doing that in Atlantic City,' "

              he said.

The late Epstein’s banishment by Trump from the Palm Beach, Florida, club appears to have occurred months before Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to state criminal charges in Florida, which included paying for sexual services from a 14-year-old girl. But it also seems to have happened more than two years after a state grand jury charged Epstein with soliciting prostitution.

Epstein, months after his banning from Mar-a-Lago, began serving what ended up being a 13-month jail term on the Florida state criminal charges.
A Trump Organization official last year denied that Epstein, who had a luxurious residence in Palm Beach, had been a dues-paying club member after the investor was arrested in July 2019 on child sex trafficking charges. The Herald, whose groundbreaking stories in late 2017 about the sweetheart nonprosecution deal that federal authorities gave Epstein in 2007 led to his indictment on federal sex trafficking charges last year, also reported that a footnote in the new book says its authors were shown Mar-a-Lago’s membership registry from more than a decade earlier.The registry revealed that Epstein had been a member.
“The member lists we saw were essentially spreadsheets,” Miami Herald reporter Nicholas Nehamas told his newspaper.
“They listed current members, honorary members and former members. Red cells indicate the closed account details for former members. Most closed accounts are labeled ‘Resigned’ and then the date that the membership ended. Epstein’s account says ‘Account closed 10/07.’”"

DECLARATION IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF'S REQUEST FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER
I, Jane Doe, the Plaintiff in this matter proceeding under a pseudonym, state as follows:
1. I am a competent adult over 18 years of age able to testify as to personal knowledge. The facts in this declaration are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, and I am competent to testify to them if called upon to do so.
2. I was subject to extreme sexual and physical abuse by the Defendants, including forcible rape, that took place at several parties of Defendant Epstein during the summer of 1994 in New York City at a residence used by Defendant Epstein. During this period, I was 13 years old. 
3. More particularly, I traveled by bus to New York City in June 1994 in the hope of starting a modeling career. I went to several modeling agencies but was told that I needed to put together a modeling portfolio before I would be considered. I then went to the Port Authority in New York City to start to make my way back home. There I met a woman who introduced herself to me as Tiffany. She told me about the parties and said that, if I would join her at the parties, I would be introduced to people who could get me into the modeling profession. Tiffany also told me I would be paid for attending.
4. The parties were held at a New York City residence that was being used by Defendant Jeffrey Epstein. Each of the parties had other minor females and a number of guests of Mr. Epstein, including Defendant Donald Trump at four of the parties I attended. I understood that both Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein knew that I was 13 years old.
5. Defendant Trump had sexual contact with me at four different parties in the summer of 1994. On the fourth and final sexual encounter with Defendant Trump, Defendant Trump tied me to a bed, exposed himself to me, and then proceeded to forcibly rape me. During the course of this savage sexual attack, I loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but he did not. Defendant Trump responded to my pleas by violently striking me in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted.
6. Immediately following this rape, Defendant Trump threatened me that, were I ever to reveal any of the details of Defendant Trump's sexual and physical abuse of me, my family and I would be physically harmed if not killed.
7. Defendant Epstein had sexual contact with me at two of the parties that summer. On the
second occasion involving Defendant Epstein, Defendant Epstein forced himself upon me and proceeded to rape me anally and vaginally despite my loud pleas to stop. Defendant Epstein then attempted to strike me about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at me that he, Defendant Epstein, should have been the one who took my virginity, not Defendant Trump, before I finally managed to break away from Defendant Epstein.
8. Immediately following this rape, just like Defendant Trump, Defendant Epstein threatened me not to ever reveal any of the details of Defendant Epstein's sexual and physical abuse of me or else my family and I would be physically harmed if not killed.
9. Both Defendants had let me know that each was a very wealthy, powerful man and indicated that they had the power, ability and means to carry out their threats. Indeed, Defendant Trump stated that I shouldn't ever say anything if I didn't want to disappeifr like Maria, a 12-year-old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with Defendant Trump and that I had not seen since that third incident, and ~hat he was capable of having my whole family killed. 
10. The duress imposed on me by Defendants not to ever reveal any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse caused to me by Defendants has not terminated and the fear it has instilled in me has not subsided. Unfortunately, making matters worse for me, I was subjected to daily painful reminders of the horrific acts of Defendant Trump via mass media coverage of him starting last summer that, over a short period of time, became continuous and unavoidable. 
11. The duress had prevented me from starting litigation before this year. However, as soon as I surfaced, I received threats. More specifically, shortly after my first complaint was filed in California on April 26, 2016, I started receiving threatening phone calls on a cell phone I then owned. The calls were never for more than 20 seconds or so before they hung up and they were always from a blocked or unavailable phone number according to my caller ID feature. Since I changed phone numbers, the threatening calls have completely stopped.
12. This litigation involves matters that are highly sensitive and of a personal nature, and I believe that identification of me would pose a risk of retaliatory physical harm to me and to others.
13. I have no reason to believe that the Defendants' threats have ever been lifted or will ever be lifted and so I request that the Court issue an order protecting me and my family from harm and harassment by the Defendants.
I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct."

DECLARATION IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF'S REQUEST FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER
I, Jane Doe, the Plaintiff in this matter proceeding under a pseudonym, state as follows:
1. I am a competent adult over 18 years of age able to testify as to personal knowledge. The facts in this declaration are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, and I am competent to testify to them if called upon to do so.
2. I was subject to extreme sexual and physical abuse by the Defendants, including forcible rape, that took place at several parties of Defendant Epstein during the summer of 1994 in New York City at a residence used by Defendant Epstein. During this period, I was 13 years old. 
3. More particularly, I traveled by bus to New York City in June 1994 in the hope of starting a modeling career. I went to several modeling agencies but was told that I needed to put together a modeling portfolio before I would be considered. I then went to the Port Authority in New York City to start to make my way back home. There I met a woman who introduced herself to me as Tiffany. She told me about the parties and said that, if I would join her at the parties, I would be introduced to people who could get me into the modeling profession. Tiffany also told me I would be paid for attending.
4. The parties were held at a New York City residence that was being used by Defendant Jeffrey Epstein. Each of the parties had other minor females and a number of guests of Mr. Epstein, including Defendant Donald Trump at four of the parties I attended. I understood that both Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein knew that I was 13 years old.
5. Defendant Trump had sexual contact with me at four different parties in the summer of 1994. On the fourth and final sexual encounter with Defendant Trump, Defendant Trump tied me to a bed, exposed himself to me, and then proceeded to forcibly rape me. During the course of this savage sexual attack, I loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but he did not. Defendant Trump responded to my pleas by violently striking me in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted.
6. Immediately following this rape, Defendant Trump threatened me that, were I ever to reveal any of the details of Defendant Trump's sexual and physical abuse of me, my family and I would be physically harmed if not killed.
7. Defendant Epstein had sexual contact with me at two of the parties that summer. On the
second occasion involving Defendant Epstein, Defendant Epstein forced himself upon me and proceeded to rape me anally and vaginally despite my loud pleas to stop. Defendant Epstein then attempted to strike me about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at me that he, Defendant Epstein, should have been the one who took my virginity, not Defendant Trump, before I finally managed to break away from Defendant Epstein.
8. Immediately following this rape, just like Defendant Trump, Defendant Epstein threatened me not to ever reveal any of the details of Defendant Epstein's sexual and physical abuse of me or else my family and I would be physically harmed if not killed.
9. Both Defendants had let me know that each was a very wealthy, powerful man and indicated that they had the power, ability and means to carry out their threats. Indeed, Defendant Trump stated that I shouldn't ever say anything if I didn't want to disappeifr like Maria, a 12-year-old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with Defendant Trump and that I had not seen since that third incident, and ~hat he was capable of having my whole family killed. 
10. The duress imposed on me by Defendants not to ever reveal any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse caused to me by Defendants has not terminated and the fear it has instilled in me has not subsided. Unfortunately, making matters worse for me, I was subjected to daily painful reminders of the horrific acts of Defendant Trump via mass media coverage of him starting last summer that, over a short period of time, became continuous and unavoidable. 
11. The duress had prevented me from starting litigation before this year. However, as soon as I surfaced, I received threats. More specifically, shortly after my first complaint was filed in California on April 26, 2016, I started receiving threatening phone calls on a cell phone I then owned. The calls were never for more than 20 seconds or so before they hung up and they were always from a blocked or unavailable phone number according to my caller ID feature. Since I changed phone numbers, the threatening calls have completely stopped.
12. This litigation involves matters that are highly sensitive and of a personal nature, and I believe that identification of me would pose a risk of retaliatory physical harm to me and to others.
13. I have no reason to believe that the Defendants' threats have ever been lifted or will ever be lifted and so I request that the Court issue an order protecting me and my family from harm and harassment by the Defendants.
I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct."

Oct. 19, 2022 - Trump is deposed in Carroll's first lawsuit. He denies Carroll's claims and calls her mentally ill.
Nov. 24, 2022 - E Jean Carroll files her second lawsuit, for defamation and battery, in which she claimed Trump’s actions account for offenses including rape in the first and third degree, sexual abuse in the first and third degree, sexual misconduct and forcible touching. The battery claim was brought under the Adult Survivors Act, which went into effect in November 2022 and provides a one-year window for sexual assault survivors who were 18 years or older at the time of their assault to file civil proceedings against their alleged abusers despite the statute of limitations. 
During the trial, Mr Trump did not mount his own defence, calling no witnesses and appearing to defend himself only in a video of his deposition, excerpts of which Ms Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, played for the court. (Ms Kaplan is not related to the judge in this case, Lewis Kaplan.)
Facing questions from Ms Kaplan, Mr Trump continued to deny the allegations he raped Ms Carroll, calling them a big fat hoax and repeating previous remarks that Ms Carroll was not his type in any way.  But at one point, he appeared to confuse Ms Carroll for his ex-wife Marla Maples, a mistake Ms Carroll's lawyers claimed undermined his argument that the writer was not his type. In the video, Mr Trump is shown an old black-and-white photo of him speaking to a man and two women at an event. It's Marla, he said, before his own lawyer told him the woman he referred to in the photo was indeed Ms Carroll.  
Trump was also asked about the Access Hollywood Grab 'Em by the Pussy clip by Ms Kaplan. Trump seemed to double down on the remarks, claiming: Historically, that's true with stars.  When Ms Kaplan pressed him on his comments, Trump said: Well, I guess if you look over the last million years, that's been largely true - not always true, but largely true, unfortunately or fortunately.  In other tense moments during the questioning, Mr Trump appeared to grow agitated with Ms Kaplan, attacking her appearance, claiming that, like Ms Carroll, you wouldn't be a choice of mine either, to be honest.   In this second suit, Carroll was awarded $5 million in damages on May 9, 2023."

And by the way, I never went to the island, and Bill Clinton went there, supposedly 28 times, Trump claimed during the press conference.

Trump was asked in Turnberry, Scotland, You had said you had not been briefed that your name was in the Epstein files, doesn't the AG have to tell you?

The president responded, in part, Well, I haven't been overly interested in it. It's a hoax that's been built up by those, way beyond proportion. Those files were run by the worst scum on earth. They were run by Comey, they were run by Garland, they were run by Biden. Those files were run for four years by those people.

The whole thing is a hoax. They ran the files. I was running against somebody that ran the files. If they had something they would have released.

Trump also referenced discredited and uncorroborated claims in the Steele dossier, a collection of unverified intelligence reports compiled in 2016 by former British spy Christopher Steele. Commissioned as opposition research during the presidential election, the dossier contains allegations about Trump's ties to Russia, including claims of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, as well as salacious and compromising personal material.

He continued, Now, they can easily put something in the files that's a phony. As an example, Christopher Steele, wrote a book, we call the 'fake news dossier.' The whole thing was a fake. The whole thing was a fake. They can put things in the file that was a fake. Those files were run by sick, sick people.

Trump was also asked again Monday about the possibility of pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell, reiterating that he is allowed to do so. Maxwell, a close associate of Epstein, the late financier and convicted child sex offender, was convicted of child sex trafficking in 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in prison.

Well, I'm allowed to give her a pardon, but nobody's approached me with it, nobody's asked me about it, Trump told reporters when asked about the possibility. It's in the news about that—that aspect of it, but right now it would be inappropriate to talk about it, he said.

The remark echoed the president's Friday comments, when he told reporters: It's something I haven't thought about... I'm allowed to do it, but it's something I have not thought about."

              Trump was asked in Turnberry, Scotland, "You had said you had not
              been briefed that your name was in the Epstein files, doesn't the
              AG have to tell you?"
            </p>
            <p>
              The president responded, in part, "Well, I haven't been overly
              interested in it. It's a hoax that's been built up by those, way
              beyond proportion. Those files were run by the worst scum on
              earth. They were run by Comey, they were run by Garland, they were
              run by Biden. Those files were run for four years by those
              people."
